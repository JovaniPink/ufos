# ufos

Providing more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, youâ€™ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## What's included

- Single HTML page (`index.html`) to demonstrate how to include Bootstrap.
- Includes Bootstrap (currently using v4.5.0) source files via npm.
- npm scripts (see `package.json`) for compiling and autoprefixing Sass, watching for changes, and starting a basic local server.
- Example stylesheet (`static/scss/style.scss`) highlighting two ways to include and customize Bootstrap.
- Example JavaScript file (`static/js/starter.js`) showing how to import all of Bootstrap and adding app logic with D3.

## Usage

Be sure to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed before proceeding.

```shell
# Clone the repo
cd ufos

# Install dependencies
npm i

# Compile Sass

npm run css-compile

# Watch Sass for changes (uses nodemon)
npm run watch

# Start local server (uses serve)
npm run server
```

For the most straightforward development, open two Terminal tabs to execute `npm run server` and `npm run watch` at the same time.

Open <http://localhost:3000> to see the page in action.

## Scripts

The following npm scripts are available to you in this starter repo. With the exception of `npm start`, the remaining scripts can be run from your command line with `npm run scriptName`.
