# UFOs

Providing more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, youâ€™ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## What's included

- Single HTML page (`index.html`) that includes Bootstrap and D3 and bundled with Parcel.
- Includes Bootstrap (currently using v4.5.0) source files via npm.
- npm scripts (see `package.json`) for compiling and autoprefixing Sass; serving index.html with Parcel; and bundling with Parcel to a 'docs' folder to host on github pages.
- Example stylesheet (`static/scss/style.scss`).
- Example app JavaScript file (`static/js/app.js`) showing how to import all of Bootstrap and adding app logic with D3.
